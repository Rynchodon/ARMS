# Autopilot
Autopilot is a mod for [Space Engineers](http://www.spaceengineersgame.com/)
that provides a simple interface for automated sequences of piloting actions
like navigation, engagement, collision avoidance, docking, and more.

It also includes radar functionality for picking up non-broadcasting objects
depending on their radar signature and distance. Radar information is
distributed across antenna networks.
