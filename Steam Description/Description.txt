[h1]Block Communication[/h1]
[url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=391453613] This script [/url] can be used to send and receive messages, filter detected grids, and execute actions based on detected grids.
Messages can be sent from one programmable block to another. Block communication will use antenna relay to send messages to other grids.
Block Communication can read detected grid information, apply filters, execute actions, and write to a TextPanel.
For usage, see the script itself.

[h1]Misc[/h1]
A solar array of panels or oxygen farms can be instructed to face the sun by adding [ Face Sun ] to the name of any solar panel or oxygen farm. See [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=457179880] Autopilot Demonstration World [/url].

[h1]Known Issues[/h1]
These are all the known issues with Autopilot. If an issue is not listed here, I do not know about it.

Autopilot cannot always control a grid if there are grids attached with landing gear. In this case, the Autopilot block will display <NO_PATH>.

Merging grids will cause Autopilot to reset or cease functioning. All Autopilot blocks should be manually reset after a merge.

Autopilot cannot fly near / through (airtight) doors; piston and rotor doors will work.

If using colour states, the model for the Autopilot block may become displaced. You can disable bUseColourState in the settings file.
