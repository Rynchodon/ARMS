[h1]Antenna Relay and Radar[/h1]
Each radio antenna, beacon, and radar transmits its location to radio antennae that are inside its broadcast range.
Each radio antenna relays the information that it has to friendly radio antennae inside its broadcast range.
Each laser antenna relays the information that is has to the laser antenna it is connected to.
Antennae, radars, and Autopilot blocks in attached grids share information.

Radar can detect any grid; the grid does not have to be broadcasting or even have power. The distance a grid can be detected by radar is based on the size of the grid and the broadcast range (power) of the radar. The maximum distance a grid can be detected is 50% of the radar's power and the minimum distance is 5% of the radar's power. Radar must remain online for a period of time to function at full capacity.

Each antenna and Autopilot block keeps track of the last time a grid was seen, where it was, and its velocity. This information is used to predict the current location of a grid.

[h1]Block Communication[/h1]
[url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=391453613] This script [/url] can be used to send and receive messages, filter detected grids, and execute actions based on detected grids.
Messages can be sent from one programmable block to another. Block communication will use antenna relay to send messages to other grids.
Block Communication can read detected grid information, apply filters, execute actions, and write to a TextPanel.
For usage, see the script itself.

[h1]Settings[/h1]
The file at "%AppData%\SpaceEngineers\Storage\363880940.sbm_Autopilot\AutopilotSettings.txt" contains the settings for Autopilot.
To reset a value to its default, simply delete it.
bAllowAutopilot - this mod can control the movement of grids
bAllowRadar - radar can be used to detect grids, otherwise functions as a beacon
bUseRemoteControl - set to true if you want to use remote controls as Autopilot blocks
bUseColourState - Autopilot will change colour of Autopilot block
bAllowWeaponControl - Enables Weapon Control and E command
yParallelPathfinder - Number of pathfinding tasks that can run in parallel
fDefaultSpeed - the desired minimum speed, when not using V
fMaxSpeed - the maximum speed Autopilot is allowed to fly at
fMaxWeaponRange - the maximum range any weapon can be set to
sWeaponCommandsNPC - commands that N.P.C. weapons will use

[h1]Known Issues[/h1]
These are all the known issues with Autopilot. If an issue is not listed here, I do not know about it.

Autopilot cannot always control a grid if there are grids attached with landing gear. In this case, the Autopilot block will display <NO_PATH>.

Merging grids will cause Autopilot to reset or cease functioning. All Autopilot blocks should be manually reset after a merge.

Autopilot cannot fly near / through (airtight) doors; piston and rotor doors will work.

If using colour states, the model for the Autopilot block may become displaced. You can disable bUseColourState in the settings file.
