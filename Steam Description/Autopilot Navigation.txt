All commands are in the display name of a Autopilot block.
[] All commands are contained within a single set of square brackets
<> Do not use angle brackets in your Autopilot block's name
:; Commands are separated by colons and/or semicolons
    Interpreter ignores all spaces
Aa Interpreter is case insensitive
Variables P and V affect all destinations that come after

To reset the Autopilot: disable "Control Thrusters", wait a second, turn it back on.
If you reset the Autopilot while landed, it will not separate before moving.

In order for Autopilot to control a grid, it must have a gyroscope, have thrusters in every direction, must not be currently controlled, and must have an owner (NPC is OK).

The G, E, and M commands all require that the target be detected, see the video for Antenna Relay and Radar.

All distances and coordinates are in metres, speed is in metres per second.
If there are multiple Autopilot blocks with commands, one will be picked arbitrarily.
The direction that the Autopilot block is facing is the direction the ship will fly in.
When the end of the commands is reached, Autopilot will start back at the first command.

[h1]Pathfinder[/h1]
[u]Path Checking[/u]
Autopilot needs clearance around it to work, the more space it has the faster it can calculate the path.
Grids can be calculated very accurately, the required clearance is based on the size of the two grids.
The required clearance for asteroids is highly dependant on ship design. Consider a cylinder that encompasses Autopilot's grid and the destination. If the asteroid intersects this cylinder, it is blocking the path.
Other obstacles will require significantly more clearance (relative to their size).

There is no collision avoidance for rotation. Autopilot does not test if rotating the ship will cause a collision. Autopilot does not test if rotating the ship would allow it to pass through an area.

[u]Pathfinding[/u]
The pathfinding is very basic, designed with the assumption that the world is mostly empty. Autopilot cannot calculate a complex path to the target.

[u]Performance[/u]
Pathfinding runs mostly in a separate thread from the rest of the game; if the pathfinder is overworked, the game will continue to run at full speed but obstacles may not be detected.
The closer an obstacle is to the desired path, the more work needs to be done to determine if the obstacle is obstructing the path.
All Autopilots share <yParallelPathfinder> threads; each pathfinder uses one thread. If all the threads are in use, the pathfinder will have to wait.

[h1]Autopilot States[/h1]
<Off> (black) EXIT was reached, or the Autopilot block is not ready
<Player> (grey) A player is controlling ship
<ERROR:(index)> (purple) You made a mistake, you need to fix it. Displays the index of the commands that could not be executed. The first command is at 0.
<No_Path> (purple) Could not find a path to the destination. Either the destination is unreachable or the path is too complex for Autopilot.

<Waiting:(time)> (yellow) a wait command was reached, display time remaining
<Landed:(time)> (yellow) grid is landed, display waiting time

<No_Dest> (dark green) could not find a valid target or destination, this state is usually temporary

[h1]Commands[/h1]
C <x>, <y>, <z> : for flying to specific world coordinates.
Example - [ C 0, 0, 0 : C 500, 500, 500 ] - fly to {0, 0, 0} then fly to {500, 500, 500}, will keep flying back and forth
C GPS:<name>:<x>:<y>:<z>: : GPS tags will be replaced with the appropriate coordinates.
Example - [ C GPS:Origin:1:2:3: ] - becomes [ C 1,2,3 ]

E <range> : Any time after E is set, engage an enemy grid. While no enemy is in range, continue following commands. Use 0 for infinite range. Use OFF to disable. Requires Weapon Control be enabled and weapons have commands.
Example - [ E 0 ] - move towards any detected enemy

EXIT : stop the Autopilot, do not loop. Useful for one-way autopilot
Example - [ E 0 : C 0, 0, 0 : EXIT ] - will target any enemy that comes into range while flying to {0, 0, 0}. Upon reaching {0, 0, 0}, will stop searching for a target

G <name> : fly towards a specific friendly grid, by name of grid (Ship Name)
Example - [ G Platform : EXIT ] - Fly to a friendly grid that has "Platform" in its name, then stop

Harvest : Extract resources from the nearest asteroid. It is recommended to put this command first so that Autopilot can tunnel out of an asteroid after the world is loaded.
Example - [ C 0,0,0 : Harvest ] - fly to {0,0,0} then harvest the closest asteroid

M <range> : same as E but for a missile
Example - [ M 0 ] - Attempt to crash into any enemy that can be detected.

W <seconds> : wait before travelling to the next destination
Example - [ C 0, 0 , 0 : W 60 : C 500, 500, 500 : EXIT ] - Will wait for 60 seconds after reaching {0, 0, 0}

[h1]Advanced Commands[/h1]
A <block>, <action> : Run an action on one or more blocks. <action> is case-sensitive. Autopilot will find every block that contains <block>, find the ITerminalAction that matches <action>, and apply it. Block must have faction share with Autopilot block's owner.
Example - [ A Thrust, OnOff_On ] - turn all the thrusters on

Asteroid : Disable asteroid collision avoidance, only affects the next destination.
Example - [ Asteroid : C 0,0,0 : C 1000,0,0 ] - fly to 0,0,0 ignoring asteroids, fly to 1000,0,0 avoiding asteroids

B <name> : for navigating to a specific block on a grid, will only affect the next use of G, E, or M. For friendly grids uses the display name; for hostile grids the definition name. Target block must be working.
Example - [ B Antenna : G Platform ] - fly to Antenna on Platform
Example - [ B Reactor : E 0 ] - will only target an enemy with a working reactor
B <name>, <direction> : <direction> indicates which direction to approach block from when landing
Example - [ L Landing Gear : B Beacon, Rightward : G Platform : W 60 ] - Attach landing gear to the right side of beacon on Platform

F <r>, <u>, <b> : fly a distance relative to self. coordinates are rightward, upward, backwards
Example - [ F 0, 0, -1000 ] - fly 1000m forward
F <distance> <direction>, ... : generic form is a comma separated list of distances and directions
Example - [ F 1000 forward ] - fly 1000m forward
Example - [ F 1000 forward, 200 downward ] - fly to a point 1000m ahead and 200m below Autopilot block

L : landing block. the block on the same grid as the Autopilot block that will be used to land. To land there must be a landing block, a target block, and a target grid [ L <localBlock> : B <targetBlock> : G <targetGrid> ]. If there is a wait command before the next destination, the grid will wait while attached. If there is a LOCK command before the next destination, the grid will not separate. If there is an EXIT command before the next destination, the grid will stay attached. Autopilot can land connectors, landing gear, and merge blocks. If you land a merge block, you need to manually reset Autopilot.
Example - [ L Connector : B Connector : G Platform : W60 : C 0,0,0 ] - attach local connector to connector on Platform, wait 60 seconds, detach, fly to {0,0,0}

LINE : Autopilot will attempt to fly in a straight line towards the next destination. Useful for flying through piston/rotor doors.

LOCK : leave landing block in locked state ( do not disconnect )
Example - [ L Connector : B Connector : G Pickup : LOCK : F 0, 0, 0 ] - connect with Pickup, fly to {0, 0, 0}

O <r>, <u>, <b> : destination offset, only works if there is a block target, cleared after reaching destination. coordinates are right, up, back. NO_PATH if offset destination is inside the boundaries of any grid (including destination).
Example - [ O 0, 500, 0 : B Antenna : G Platform ] - fly to 500m above Antenna on Platform
O <distance> <direction>, ... : generic form is a comma separated list of distances and directions
Example - [ O 500 upward : B Antenna : G Platform ] - fly to 500m above Antenna on Platform
Example - [ O 100 forward, 500 upward : B Antenna : G Platform ] - fly to 100m ahead of and 500m above Antenna

P <range> : how close the grid needs to fly to the destination, default is 100m. Ignored for M.
Example - [ P 10 : F 0, 0, -100 ] - Fly 100m forward

R <f> : match direction, needs a target block. <f> is the target block's direction that the Autopilot block will face
Example - [ R Forward : B Antenna : G Platform ] - fly to Antenna on Platform, then face Autopilot block to antenna forward
R <f>, <u> : match orientation (direction and roll). <f> as above. <u> which block direction will be Autopilot block's Up
Example - [ R Forward, Upward : B Antenna : G Platform ] - fly to Antenna on Platform, then face Autopilot block to antenna forward, then roll so that Antenna's Upward will match Autopilot block's upward.

T <name> : fetch commands from the public text of a text panel named <name>, starting at the first [ and ending at the first following ]
Example - [ T Command Panel ] - fetch commands from "Command Panel"
T <name>, <sub> : as above, the search for [ and ] will begin after the first occurrence of <sub>. It is recommend to make <sub> unique, so that it will not be confused with anything else.
Example - [ T Command Panel, {Line 4} ] - where "Command Panel" contains ... {Line 4} [ C 0,0,0 ] ... fly to {0,0,0}

V <cruise> : when travelling faster than <cruise> reduce thrust (zero or very little thrust)
Example - [ V 10 : C 0, 0, 0 : C 500, 500, 500 ] - fly back and forth between {0, 0, 0} and {500, 500, 500}, cruising when above 10m/s. The default for <cruise> is set in the settings file.
V <cruise>, <slow> : when speed is below <cruise>, accelerate; when speed is between <cruise> and <slow>, cruise; when speed is above <slow>, decelerate. The default for <cruise> is set in the settings file, the default for <slow> is infinity (practically).
Example - [ V 10, 20 : C 0, 0, 0 : C 500, 500, 500 ] - fly back and forth between {0, 0, 0} and {500, 500, 500}, staying between 10m/s and 20m/s.

[b]Directions[/b] : can be { Forward, Backward, Leftward, Rightward, Upward, Downward }. Autopilot only checks the first letter, so abbreviations will work. For example, "Forward" can be "Fore" or "F"
[b]Distances[/b] : for F, O, and P can be modified by km(kilometres) or Mm(megametres). For example, "3.5M" or "3.5Mm" is 3.5 megametres or 3 500 kilometres.

[h1]More Examples[/h1]
[B Thrust : M 0] Attempt to crash into the nearest enemy grid's thrusters.
[E 300 : C 0,0,0 : C 1000,0,0] Patrol between two points until an enemy grid comes into range (300m), then fly towards enemy grid.
[P 10 : F 0,0,-100 : M 0] Fly forward 100 metres then convert to missile. If no enemy is found, keep moving forward 100m at a time. Can lock onto an enemy any time after first move.
[P 1000 : G MiningBase : W 600 : G MainBase : W 300] fly to within 1km of MiningBase, wait for 10 minutes, fly to within 1km of MainBase, wait 5 minutes.
[ R Forward, Upward : B PlatConn : L MyConn : G Platform ] set the orientation of the Autopilot block to Forward, Upward (relative to PlatConn) and dock. This is useful when a specific docking orientation is required due to lack of space.
